# Tunisian-currency-detection
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate Tunisian currency detection system using the YOLOv7 object detection model, with the dataset annotated by Roboflow. The system will be designed to recognize different denominations of Tunisian banknotes, providing a reliable tool for visually impaired individuals.
